Collection of regular expressions
=====

Hey guys. Regular expressions are cool but difficult. I'm starting my own collection of useful regex. Hope you will add a lot!

##Urls

```
/(http)[a-z]?:\/\/[a-z]{3,}.domain\.tld/
```

### What does it?

Searching for sub.domain.tld (sub may habe up to 4 characters).

### I used it

I usid in a replacement to cut off https://www.domain.tld od a string.
